基于双β衰变实验的数据特征，把它作为有监督的分类问题，通过卷积神经网络，实现对探测器事例类别的预测。与此同时，尝试在数据集上使
用迁移学习，获得了不错的结果。并且当信号更精确、维度信息更多时，迁移学习更加明显的体现出其优势。

In this paper, based on the data features of double β decay, we treat it as a supervised classification problem, and train it with CNNS to achieve the classification prediction of detector cases. In addition, we tried to use transfer learning on the data set and got good results.
